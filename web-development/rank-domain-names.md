## Rank Domain Name Ideas

### Contributors:
+ Gabriel Mongefranco (@gabrielmongefranco), Eisenberg Family Depression Center

### Description
This prompt will ask GPT to infer a ranking, from 1 to 100, for a list of domain names that one is considering.

### Template
**For: GPT**  <br />
**Prompt:**
<pre><code>
Assign a score from 1 to 100 to the following domain names, where 1 is a terrible choice for international audiences, and 100 is an excellent choice for both English and non-English speakers (based on the most popular languages spoken in the United States).  
A score of 100 would also imply the domain is easy to say and easy to remember.  
Sort the results by ranking in descending order.  
<var>[INPUT]</var>.
</code></pre>
<br />


### Examples

Rank domain ideas for a service to host multiple UMich research studies, with sub-domain for each individual study (using "Thrive" as an example):<br />
