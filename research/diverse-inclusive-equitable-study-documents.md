### Description
Use this prompt to get hints and an example of how to make your study documents more inclusive. You can replace the phrase "research study document" with something more specific, such as IRB study proposal, study consent document, etc. depending on what you are revising.
Note that the suggestions given will be very general. Do not use the example that GPT gives you without first reviewing it.

How can I make the following study consent more equitable, implementing DEI practices?

We are asking you to take part in a research study being done by Dolores Umbridge, a student at Montclair State University. Being in this study is optional.

 

If you choose to be in the study, you will complete a survey. This survey will help us learn more about proper usage of templates.  You were selected to participate because of your affiliation to Montclair State University and asked to participate in effort to improve the IRB submission process. The survey will take about 15 minutes to complete.

 

You can skip questions that you do not want to answer or stop the survey at any time. The survey is anonymous, and no one will be able to link your answers back to you.

 

You will remain anonymous. Risks of participating in this study are feeling possible fatigue or boredom while answering survey questions.  You and others may benefit from this study if the outcome speeds up the IRB submission and approval process.  To compensate you for the time you spend in this study, you will receive a $10.00 Amazon gift card.  A link to receive this compensation will appear at the end of the survey.

 

We strongly advise that you do not use an employer issued electronic device, laptop, phone or WIFI to respond to this survey, as many employers monitor use of all devices.

 

Questions? Please contact Rubieus Hagrid at ubhagrid@hogwarts.edu. If you have questions or concerns about your rights as a research participant, you can call the MSU Institutional Review Board at 000-000-0000 or email xxxxxxxx@montclair.edu.

To enhance the equity of the study consent form and implement Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices, consider the following suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language:
   - Use language that is inclusive of all potential participants regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, age, ability, etc.
   - Avoid any terms or phrases that could be seen as exclusive or discriminatory.

2. Accessibility:
   - Offer the consent form and survey in multiple formats (e.g., large print, braille, audio).
   - Ensure that the online survey is accessible to people with disabilities (compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG).

3. Clarity:
   - Clearly explain any technical terms or processes to make the information accessible to individuals from various educational backgrounds.
   - Offer translation services or versions of the consent form and survey in different languages prevalent within the Montclair State University community.

4. Consent Process:
   - Respect for autonomy should be highlighted, emphasizing that participation is completely voluntary and will not affect their status at Montclair State University.
   - Include an assurance that choosing not to participate or withdrawing from the study will not result in any penalties or loss of benefits.

5. Compensation:
   - Consider whether the compensation offered is fair and whether it might disproportionately influence participation from certain groups (e.g., those who may be financially disadvantaged).
   - Provide options for compensation that accommodate different needs or preferences (e.g., gift cards for multiple stores or the option to donate the compensation to a cause).

6. Privacy and Anonymity:
   - Reassure potential participants about the steps taken to protect their privacy and the confidentiality of their data.
   - Explain why anonymity is important for the study and how it will be maintained.

7. Contact Information:
   - Provide clear and accessible contact information for the researcher(s) and IRB, ensuring that potential participants feel comfortable reaching out.

8. Cultural Sensitivity:
   - Be mindful of cultural holidays or events that may affect the timing of the research.
   - If the study addresses sensitive topics, be sure to acknowledge and respect cultural differences in perceptions and attitudes.

Here is an example of a revised study consent form implementing DEI practices:

---

We invite you to participate in a research study conducted by Dolores Umbridge, who is part of the scholarly community at Montclair State University. Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you have the autonomy to decline or withdraw at any point without any consequences to you.

Should you decide to participate, you will complete a survey that seeks your valuable insights on the usage of templates. Your perspective is vital for enhancing our Institutional Review Board (IRB) submission process. The survey is estimated to require about 15 minutes of your time.

You are free to skip any questions or stop participation at your discretion. Your responses will be confidential, and the survey design ensures your anonymity.

Participating may pose minimal risks, such as temporary fatigue or boredom. It is our hope that outcomes from this research will benefit you and others by streamlining the IRB process. In appreciation of your time, we will provide a $10.00 Amazon gift card, or you may select an alternative form of compensation, with details provided upon survey completion.

We recommend using a non-work device and internet connection when participating, as many employers monitor device usage.

If you have any inquiries, please reach out to Rubieus Hagrid at ubhagrid@hogwarts.edu. Should you have any concerns regarding your rights as a participant, contact our IRB at 973-655-7583 or reviewboard@montclair.edu.

This research has received Montclair State University IRB approval (Your IRB # here: i.e. FY17-18-0000).

To create an equitable research study document that complies with the legal and ethical standards you've mentioned, follow these key guidelines:

1. **45 CFR 46.116 (Common Rule)**: Ensure clear and concise information on the research purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. Obtain informed consent, provide contact details for inquiries about participants' rights, and ensure voluntary participation.

2. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: If the research includes EU citizens, ensure data privacy and protection measures, gather explicit consent for data processing, and give participants the right to access or erase their data.

3. **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: Make all materials and activities accessible. Offer reasonable accommodations for participants with disabilities.

4. **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**: For electronic documents and online surveys, follow WCAG standards to accommodate participants with different abilities, ensuring digital accessibility.

5. **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**: Respect the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family in the research process.
